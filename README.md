# GraphQLearn

Learning GraphQL through setting up a simple back end to serve up to data types connect by a many to many

## MongoDB version

See mongoDB branch for code running with mongoose

## SQL & Join Monster

Join monster batches SQL queries so that GraphQL runs efficiently instead of a bunch of sequential small queries, this is also working, checkout the master branch

Currently this branch has a disadvantage in that I can't get it to fully resolve a freshly inserted object, mongoDB on the other hand can deeply query an item at the same time as it inserts it
